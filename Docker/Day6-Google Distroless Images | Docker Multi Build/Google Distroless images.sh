Google distroless images are extremly light in weight in nature (2mb)

why these images are less in weight (it doesn't contain shell/bash in it)

we can not go & login into the container ( docker exec -it app1 bash)

# these images are using for security practices

# you can not install any packages / softwares on top this images
