Here are the different types of load balancers available on AWS:

Application Load Balancer (ALB): 
An ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and can route traffic based on advanced routing rules, such as URL path, host header, or HTTP headers. 
It is well-suited for modern, microservices-based applications.

Network Load Balancer (NLB): 
An NLB operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is designed to handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. 
It is well-suited for load balancing TCP/UDP traffic.

Gateway Load Balancer (GLB): 
A GLB is used to deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of third-party virtual appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and other middleware.

Classic Load Balancer (CLB): 
A CLB is the original Elastic Load Balancing service provided by AWS. 
It operates at both the application layer (Layer 7) and transport layer (Layer 4). 
CLB is suitable for basic load balancing needs.
