Here are the different types of routing policies available in Amazon Route 53:
Simple Routing Policy:
Use this policy when you have a single resource (e.g., a web server) that performs a specific function for your domain.
You can use simple routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
Failover Routing Policy:
Use this policy when you want to configure active-passive failover for your resources.
You can use failover routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
Geolocation Routing Policy:
Use this policy when you want to route traffic based on the geographic location of your users.
You can use geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
Geoproximity Routing Policy:
Use this policy when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from one location to another.
You can use geoproximity routing to create records in a private hosted zone.
IP-Based Routing:
This allows you to fine-tune your DNS routing by using your understanding of your network, applications, and clients to make the best routing decisions for your end users.
IP-based routing gives you granular control to optimize performance or reduce network costs by uploading user-IP-to-endpoint mappings to Route 53.
Latency-Based Routing:
This policy routes traffic to the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency for the user.
Latency-based routing is based on data that Route 53 collects and keeps up to date.


################### Layman Language ###############

latency -latency means it will take the nearest data centre. To avoid the latency.

Failover -if one server goes down, the secondary server will take over

Weighted -example, there are a lot of uses in India due to large scale users. All the heads are going to US 
using latency to avoid such things we need to load balancing that is waited.

Geo location -Jio location will strictly follow the band rules, Indian New Zealand should go to India only 
and US region. User should go to US only.

Multivalues -we can give multiple server IP in multi values, specifically, it takes any one of the IP.
