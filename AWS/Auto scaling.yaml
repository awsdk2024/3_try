Vertical and horizontal scaling are two different approaches to scaling your infrastructure in AWS:

Vertical Scaling:
Vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (such as CPU, memory, or storage) of an existing EC2 instance or other AWS resource.
This is typically done by stopping the instance, changing the instance type to one with more resources, and then restarting the instance.
Vertical scaling is useful when your application needs more compute power or memory, but it is limited by the maximum resources available for a single instance.

Horizontal Scaling:
Horizontal scaling involves adding more EC2 instances or other AWS resources to your infrastructure to handle increased load or demand.
This is typically done using Auto Scaling groups, which can automatically add or remove instances based on predefined scaling policies.
Horizontal scaling is useful when your application can be easily distributed across multiple instances, and you need to scale out to handle more traffic or workload.

AWS supports both vertical and horizontal scaling for various services, including:
EC2 Auto Scaling: Allows you to scale EC2 instances horizontally by adding or removing instances based on demand.
DynamoDB Auto Scaling: Allows you to scale the provisioned read and write capacity of DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes vertically or horizontally.
Aurora Auto Scaling: Allows you to scale the number of Aurora Read Replicas provisioned for an Aurora DB cluster horizontally.
